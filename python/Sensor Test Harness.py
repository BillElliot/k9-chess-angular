#
# This program pretends to be seven sensors to enable quick evaluation tuning and
# prototyping of a collision detection algorithm for K9
#
# It will generate a set of sensor data every 20ms and transmit that to
# a websocket as a JSON string. The initial destination is assumed to be node-RED,
# but it could be any runtime platform that supports websockets.
#
# The sensor data will always begin at the extremities of the sensors and then 
# modified in line with the expected movement of the robot and a random element.
# Once it is clear a collision has occurred the harness will reset with another
# scenario.  Each message will have an identifier enabling the message to be correlated
# with any detected collision
