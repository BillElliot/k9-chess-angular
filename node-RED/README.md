# Installation Steps #


## Pre-requisites ##
_(Lower versions may work, but I have tested on these versions and so am considering them to be the base versions)_
1. Node v8.0.0
2. npm v5.0.3
3. Node-RED v0.16.2

Apart from this, you may have to install the following nodes
<pre>

  <tr>
    <td>node-red-node-serialport</td>
    <td>v0.4.2</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>node-red-node-smooth</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>node_red_dashboard</td>
    <td>v2.3.11</td>
